To run Bullseye comparisons, navigate to model-augmented-mutual-information and run `roc_gen.sh'.
For feature mappings, uncomment line 75 in roc_gen.py to enable training mapping.

Note: We have adapted code for the paper: [Model-Augmented Conditional Mutual Information Estimation for Feature Selection (UAI 2020)](https://github.com/syanga/model-augmented-mutual-information) and also [pycit](https://github.com/syanga/pycit). Hence, we have added the modified sources here.
